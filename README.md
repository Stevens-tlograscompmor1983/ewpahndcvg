OMG, I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Heart Eyes and honestly, I'm all over the place right now. Like, where do I even begin? That   was one wild ride, you know what I mean? I'm not sure if it's just me or if staying up late is making everything feel more intense, but seriously, the emotions are jumping all over the spectrum.

First off, can we talk about that main character's haircut?! I mean, what even was that??? Part of me is like, fam, who did that to you? But also, it kinda grew on me by the end. I guess if I were to describe it, it'd be like a mix between high fashion and 'I woke up like this.'

> Then there was that scene where they totally nailed that awkward first date vibe. Honestly, it felt like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a trainwreck in slow motion, and I couldn't look away. LOL, I had to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 that part again. Pure gold.

But then, right after, they hit you with the heavy stuff, and I legit almost cried. Like, how do you do that and expect me not to have a breakdown? Just emotional whiplash all over the place. Wonder if caffeine is making me feel this more than usual or if it’s just that well done.

Oh, also, the soundtrack! Seriously, the music was on point. I should’ve guessed they’d have killer tracks when the trailer dropped, but damn, hearing it in the   just leveled it up. Might need to listen to it again while cutting hair, might make life’s simple stuff feel like an epic battle LOL.

Just remembered! I’m supposed to tell you to definitely find time to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , kiiinda hate myself for not reminding you sooner. It’s such a vibe though. 

```
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { printf(Why is this here?
); }
```

Anyway, I gotta crash soon. I’m dead tired but all that   energy won’t let me chill just yet. Maybe I’ll scroll through some memes till I pass out or something. Text me your thoughts if you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it, yeah? Need someone else to ride this rollercoaster with. 💤
